# PostApocalypse

This was my Honors Project for my Mobile Programming Class (CSC 430).
It is a game where you are a mailman trying to deliver packages without being killed by the monsters.
It was originally run using Android Studio. These are just the code and visual assets files.
You can see a video about it at https://youtu.be/v72L7-LO8Z4?si=FHUamy1TTFF-Mhgg
